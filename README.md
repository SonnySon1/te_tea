# 🎨 TETEA FE (Frontend UI Prototype)

**TETEA FE** is the original user interface (UI) prototype for the TETEA application. Built using Flutter, this version focuses solely on the visual layout and navigation without integration to the backend (API). It serves as a foundational design before full API integration in [TETEA App](https://github.com/SonnySon1/tetea_app).
